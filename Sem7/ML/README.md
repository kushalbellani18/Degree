# Machine Learning #
My college gave me a challenge task. I am very passion to work and explore it. Here, a given list of file name along with description as below:

- [Lab 2](Lab2_7509.ipynb): Understanding feature extraction using visualization as well as statistic.
- [Lab 3](Lab3_7509_part2.ipynb): Exploring a regression contains Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and finally Polynomial Regression. It's dataset is **Rental Bike Share**.
- [Lab 4](Lab4_7509.ipynb): Same as Lab 3 except it's dataset is **Metro Interstate Traffic Volume**.
- [Lab 5](Lab5_7509.ipynb): Exploring a classificaion contains Logistic Regression, KNN classifier, and Decision Tree. It is used for Binary Classification as target variable.
- [Lab 6](Lab6_7509.ipynb): Same as Lab 6. However, It is used for multi-classification as target variable.
- [Lab 7](Lab7_7509.ipynb): Exploring a cluster contains K Means, DBSCAN and Fuzzy C Means.
- [Lab 8](Lab8_7509.ipynb): Took dataset from Lab 3 & 4 (that's mean, Regression) and Lab 5 & 6 (that's mean, Classification). In addition, we can use ANN (Artifical Neural Network) to predict it.
- [Lab 9](Lab9_7509.ipynb): We can predict an Image using classification with the help of Neural Networks. Unfortunately, my train is died due to issue on some hardware like space full or gpu blast, I guess. üòê
- [Lab 10](Lab10_7509.ipynb): Basic RNN for Google Stock Price.
