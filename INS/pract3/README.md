## [Caeser Cipher Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
The algorithm has 2 files in python which are followed as below:
* client1.py file can entered by a user,
* server1.py file can processed itself when you are done in client1.py.

_It can used in socket interface._

## [Mono-alphabetic Cipher Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher)
The algorithm has only one python file, (client2.py).
