# Bank Application #
We can create a basic Bank application through digital by Java code. We can create it by connecting file-based system instead of database since I was explore it for challenge in my collage. 

## Files ##
- **bankAcc.java:** It is a source code of Java. It has a lot of class for interface or class.
- **bankAccountList.txt:** To store a user's profile in the file.
- In **transactionHistory**, since we have a key in above file, we can store a transaction by log file by individual.
